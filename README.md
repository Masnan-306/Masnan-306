## 🌐 Glober AI: Redefining Content Localization

During my internship at [Glober AI](https://www.glober.ai/), I designed and built an AWS-based asynchronous microservice architecture and CI/CD Jenkins pipeline that deploys it. This system powers advanced content localization services, including:

- **Subtitle Removals**
- **Image Upscaling**
- **Voice Cloning**

If you're looking for innovative, cost-effective AI solutions for generative content localization, I highly recommend exploring Glober AI. It offers an end-to-end localization service, covering everything from market analysis to content creation tailored for specific audience groups.
